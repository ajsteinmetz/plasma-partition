## Matter-antimatter origin of cosmic magnetism

## abstract
We explore the hypothesis that the abundant presence of relativistic antimatter (positrons) in the primordial universe is the source of the intergalactic magnetic fields we observe in the universe today. We evaluate both Landau diamagnetic and magnetic dipole moment paramagnetic properties of the very dense primordial electron-positron $e^{+}e^{-}$-plasma, and obtain in quantitative terms the relatively small magnitude of the $e^{+}e^{-}$ magnetic moment polarization asymmetry required to produce a consistent self-magnetization in the universe.
