## A short survey of matter-antimatter evolution in the primordial universe

## abstract
In the early universe above temperature $T>20{\rm\ keV}$ there was an gargantuan density of electron-positron pairs which rapidly vanished. We explore the possibility that this phenomenon was responsible for generating primordial magnetic fields in the universe. At higher electron-positron pair densities, spin paramagnetism is dominant over the Landau orbital diamagnetism of the gas. In this work, we seek to describe the magnetization of (and possible magnetogenesis within) the primordial electron-positron plasma as it underwent a rapid drop in density of order ${\cal O}(10^{12})$ relative to the baryon density in the temperature range $200{\rm\ keV}>T>20{\rm\ keV}$. Our analysis focuses on the partition function of the relativistic Fermi gas at finite temperatures.
