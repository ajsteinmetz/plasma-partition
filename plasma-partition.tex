\begin{abstract}
    We explore in the temperature range $200\keV>T>20\keV$ the primordial Universe magnetization driven by spin paramagnetism  of the ultra dense electron-positron plasma. The $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair density was more than $10^{8}$ greater than the baryon density. Pairs fully disappear only below $T=20\keV$. 
    
%    At these high densities, strong dampening by internal scattering needs to be included in any study of magneto-hydrodynamic flow. The rapid disappearance of $e^{+}e^{-}$ at temperatures $T<511\keV$ occured much faster than the corresponding drop in temperature.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
\noindent  
Unlike electric fields which cannot be supported at large scales due to the charge neutrality of the universe, cosmic magnetic fields are easily generated~\cite{giovannini2003magnetized,kronberg1994extragalactic} by a variety of physicals phenomena and once present are difficult to eliminate. As result macroscopic domains of magnetic fields have been found: around compact objects (stars, planets, etc...), between stars, within galaxies, between galaxies in clusters, and surprisingly in the deep extra-galactic void spaces where little matter exists. 

Therefore we search for a common mechanism that could produce the observed magnetic diversity in the universe.  Here we address the finding~\cite{rafelski2023short} potentially related to cosmic magnetism that above temperature $T>20\keV$ there was a relatively large electron-positron pair abundance, reaching about 100 million pairs per baryon at pre-BBN temperature $T=200\keV$. This situation is shown in \rf{fig:densityratio}. How this figure is obtained is described  further below. Given the extremly large abundance in the pre-BBN environment of particles with largest magnetic moment, electrons and positrons,  we consider in the following the hypothesis that primordial magnetization of the Universe could be driven by spin paramagnetism.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In \rf{fig:densityratio} the electron-to-baryon ratio $n_{e^{-}}/n_{B}$ is shown as the solid blue line while the positron-to-baryon ratio $n_{e^{+}}/n_{B}$ is emerges as the dashed red line below $T=20.3\keV$. The two vertical dashed green lines denote temperatures $T=m_{e}\simeq511\keV$ and $T=20.3\keV$. The two horizontal black dashed lines denote the relativistic $T>>m_e$ abundance of $n_{e^{\pm}}/n_{B}=4.47\times10^{8}$ and post-annihilation  $n_{e^{-}}/n_{B}=0.87$ where deviation from unity arises due to presence of bound neutrons. Above temperature $T\gtrsim85\keV$, the $e^{+}e^{-}$ primordial plasma density exceeded that of the Sun's core density $n_{e}\simeq6\times10^{26}{\rm\ cm}^{-3}$~\cite{bahcall2001solar}. 



density of electron-positron pairs which rapidly vanished as the universe cooled. We explore the possibility that this phenomenon was responsible for generating primordial magnetic fields (PMF) in the universe. 

We note that We analyze the magnetized relativistic fermion partition function focusing on the spin contribution to magnetization showing that magnetization is nonzero even for a nearly symmetric particle-antiparticle gas. At higher electron-positron $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair densities, spin paramagnetism is dominant over the Landau orbital diamagnetism of the gas.

If the early universe was highly magnetized, the rapid $10^{9}$ drop in $e^{+}e^{-}$ density relative to the baryon density in the temperature range $2000\keV>T>20\keV$ likely had a large effect on the overall magnetization of the universe. This combination of strong magnetic fields, high matter-antimatter density, and relatively high temperatures (far higher than the Sun's core temperature~\cite{bahcall2001solar} of $T_{\odot}=1.37\keV$) make this era unique in cosmology and astrophysics. We operate under the assumption that the observed inter-galactic magnetic fields (IGMF) are primordial in nature and are present, if not created fully or in part, during the electron-positron epoch of the early universe. The conventional elaboration of the origins for cosmic magnetic fields are detailed in~\cite{gaensler2004origin,durrer2013cosmological,batista2021gammaray}.

These intergalactic fields present a challenge both experimentally and theoretically in that they are (a) difficult to measure and (b) difficult to explain using known physics. The bounds for IGMF at a coherent length scale of $1{\rm\ Mpc}$ are today~\cite{neronov2010evidence,taylor2011extragalactic,pshirkov2015new,vernstrom2021discovery}
\begin{align}
    \label{igmf}
    10^{-8}{\rm\ G}>\mathcal{B}_{\rm IGFM}>10^{-16}{\rm\ G}\,.
\end{align}

Faraday rotation from distant radio active galaxy nuclei (AGN)~\cite{pomakov2022redshift} suggest that neither dynamo nor astrophysical processes would sufficiently account for the presence of magnetic fields in the universe today if the IGMF strength was around the upper bound of ${\cal B}_{\rm IGMF}\simeq30-60{\rm\ nG}$ as found in~\cite{vernstrom2021discovery}. Such strong magnetic fields would then require that at least some portion of the IGMF arise from primordial sources that predate the formation of stars and galaxies, or the cosmic microwave background (CMB). It was shown by Jedamzik and Pogosian~\cite{jedamzik2020relieving} that the presence of ${\cal B}_{\rm PMF}\simeq0.1{\rm\ nG}$ could be sufficient to explain the Hubble tension. Excessively large pre-recombination primordial fields would lead to early universe baryon inhomogeneities which in turn would produce anisotropies in the CMB~\cite{jedamzik2013smallscale}. Field strengths of around a tenth of a nanoGauss is also near the more stringent upper bound for PMFs found in~\cite{pshirkov2015new,jedamzik2019stringent}. Conversely, measurements of synchrotron radiation from \lq\lq blazar\rq\rq\ AGN whose jets are pointed towards the Earth provide the lower bound~\cite{neronov2010evidence,taylor2011extragalactic} on IGMFs seen in \req{igmf}. Due to cosmological redshift, and the conservation of magnetic flux through a comoving surface, PMFs would have extraordinary field strengths during the various primordial plasmas of the early universe subject to whatever temperature they were initially generated in.

\section{Electron-positron abundance}
\label{sec:abundance}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent In \rf{fig:densityratio} we present the electron-positron number density ratio relative to the baryon number density in the temperature range $2000\keV>T>20\keV$ which bounded the $e^{+}e^{-}$ epoch of the early universe. After neutrino freeze-out~\cite{birrell2014relic}, around $T=2\MeV$, the comoving density of $e^{+}e^{-}$ remained constant fixed to a value of 
\begin{align}
    \label{comovingdensity}
    \frac{n_{e^{+}}+n_{e^{-}}}{n_{B}}\simeq0.9\times10^{9}\,,
\end{align}
or almost 1 billion times more abundant than the baryons. Constancy of this ratio for temperature above $T\gtrsim500\keV$ originates from the conserved entropy-per-baryon ratio~\cite{fromerth2012quarkgluon}. This indicates that the entropy content in the light charged leptons was also constant and conserved during this period. As the universe cooled below temperature $T<m_{e}$ (the electron mass), the electron and positron comoving density depleted (falling nine orders of magnitude) as the annihilation process outpaced the photon fusion pair production process via
\begin{align}
    \label{fusion}
    e^{+}+e^{-}\leftrightarrow\gamma+\gamma\,.
\end{align}
At $T_{\rm split}=20.3\keV$, the charged lepton asymmetry (mirrored by the baryon asymmetry) became evident as the few remaining excess electrons could no longer annihilate as the positrons vanished entirely. This process took no longer than an afternoon lunch break. Because of charge neutrality, the post-annihilation comoving ratio $n_{e^{-}}/n_{B}=0.87$~\cite{rafelski2023short} is slightly offset from unity by the presence of $\alpha$ particles and the other neutron containing light elements produced during Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN).

\section{Primordial magnetic fields}
\label{sec:primordial}
\noindent As the universe undergoes isotropic expansion, the temperature decreases as 
\begin{align}
    \label{tscale}
    T(t)=T_{0}\frac{a_{0}}{a(t)}\rightarrow T(z)=T_{0}(1+z)\,,
\end{align}
where $a(t)$ is the scale factor defined by the FLRW metric~\cite{weinberg1972gravitation} and $z$ is the redshift. The comoving temperature $T_{0}$ is given by the present day temperature of the CMB and the contemporary scale factor $a_{0}=1$ is usually set to unity. Within a homogeneous magnetic domain, the magnetic field varies~\cite{durrer2013cosmological} over cosmic expansion as
\begin{align}
    \label{bscale}
    {\cal B}(t)={\cal B}_{0}\frac{a_{0}^{2}}{a^{2}(t)}\rightarrow{\cal B}(z)={\cal B}_{0}\left(1+z\right)^{2}\,,
\end{align}
where ${\cal B}_{0}$ is the comoving value of the magnetic field defined by the contemporary value of the magnetic field today given in \req{igmf}. Non-primordial magnetic fields which are generated through other mechanisms (such as dynamo or astrophysical sources) will have expressions which differ~\cite{pomakov2022redshift}. The presence of matter and late universe structure formation also serve to contaminate the primordial field evolution in \req{bscale}, therefore it is only in deep intergalactic space where primordial fields would remain preserved over cosmic time.

From \req{tscale} and \req{bscale}, we see there is a natural ratio which is conserved over cosmic expansion. For particles (such as $e^{+}e^{-})$ with charge magnitude $q=|e|$ in a homogeneous primordial magnetic field, we can define a dimensionless cosmic magnetic energy scale in natural units ($c=\hbar=k_{B}=1$) as
\begin{align}
    \label{tbscale}
    b_{0}\equiv\frac{q{\cal B}(t)}{T^{2}(t)}=\frac{q{\cal B}_{0}}{T_{0}^{2}}={\rm\ const.}\qquad10^{-3}>b_{0}>10^{-11}\,,
\end{align}
which can be completely prescribed by comoving values. We compute the bounds for this cosmic magnetic scale by using the present day observations given by \req{igmf} and the CMB temperature $T_{0}=2.7{\rm\ K}\simeq2.3\times10^{-4}\eV$~\cite{aghanim2018planck}.

We take inspiration from Ch. 9 of Melrose's treatise on magnetized plasmas~\cite{melrose2008quantum}. Our focus however will be on the bulk properties of thermalized plasmas in (near) equilibrium. In considering $e^{+}e^{-}$ plasma, we introduce the microscopic energy of the charged $q$ relativistic fermion within a homogeneous ($z$-direction) magnetic field~\cite{steinmetz2018magnetic}. The energy eigenvalue is given by
\begin{align}
    \label{kgp}
    E^{\pm}_{n}(p_{z},{\cal B})=\sqrt{m_{e}^{2}+p_{z}^{2}+q{\cal B}\left(2n+1\mp\frac{g}{2}\right)}\,,\qquad n\in0,1,2,\ldots
\end{align}
where $p_{z}$ is the momentum parallel to the field axis and $n$ is the Landau orbital quantum number. The subscript $\pm$ refers to the spin polarization along the field axis: parallel $(+)$ or anti-parallel $(-)$. The parameter $g$ is the gyro-magnetic ($g$-factor) of the particle. We rearrange \req{kgp} by pulling the spin dependency and the ground state Landau orbital into the mass writing
\begin{align}
    \label{effmass}
    E^{\pm}_{n}={\tilde m}_{\pm}\sqrt{1+\frac{p_{z}^{2}}{{\tilde m}_{\pm}^{2}}+\frac{2q{\cal B}n}{{\tilde m}_{\pm}^{2}}}\,,\qquad {\tilde m}_{\pm}^{2}=m_{e}^{2}+q{\cal B}\left(1\mp\frac{g}{2}\right)\,,
\end{align}
where we introduced the effective polarized mass ${\tilde m}_{\pm}$ which is distinct for each spin alignment and is a function of magnetic field strength ${\cal B}$. The effective polarized mass ${\tilde m}_{\pm}$ allows us to describe the $e^{+}e^{-}$ plasma with the spin effects almost wholly separated from the Landau characteristics of the gas when considering plasma thermodynamic properties.

\section{Fermi statistics and fugacity}
\label{sec:fugacity}
\noindent If the Cosmological Principle is correct~\cite{abdalla2022cosmology}, the universe is nearly homogeneous and isotropic on the largest scales. Localized inhomogeneities of matter evolution are often non-trivial and generally be solved numerically using magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD)~\cite{melrose2008quantum,vazza2017simulations}. Our approach however will be to look at the bulk properties of the relativistic gasses of the early universe via the thermal Fermi-Dirac distribution. The magnetized relativistic fermion partition function is given, in a generalized form, by
\begin{align}
    \label{partition}
    \ln{\cal Z}_{e^{+}e^{-}}=\frac{2q{\cal B}V}{(2\pi)^{2}}\sum_{\sigma}^{\pm}\sum_{s}^{\pm}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\int_{0}^{\infty}\left[\ln\left(1+\lambda_{\sigma}\xi_{s}e^{-E_{n}^{s}/T}\right)\right]\,,\qquad\Upsilon_{\sigma}^{s}=\lambda_{\sigma}\xi_{s}=\exp{\frac{\mu_{\sigma}+\eta_{s}}{T}}\,,
\end{align}
where $\sigma$ is a sum over electron and positron states and $s$ is a sum over polarizations. $V$ denotes our proper volume. We define the generalized fugacity $\Upsilon_{\sigma}^{s}$ as the product of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[a.] Chemical fugacity $\lambda_{\sigma}=\exp{(\mu_{\sigma}/T)}$
    \item[b.] Spin fugacity $\xi_{s}=\exp{(\eta_{s}/T)}$
\end{itemize}
The chemical fugacity $\lambda_{\sigma}$ is defined in terms of the chemical potential $\mu_{\sigma}=\sigma\mu$ and due to charge conservation~\cite{elze1980relativistic} can be written as 
\begin{align}
    \label{cpotential}
    \mu\equiv\mu_{e^{-}}=-\mu_{e^{+}}\,,\qquad
    \lambda\equiv\lambda_{e^{-}}=\lambda_{e^{+}}^{-1}\,.
\end{align}

While the primordial electron-positron plasma era was overall charge neutral, there was a small asymmetry in the charged leptons from baryon asymmetry~\cite{canetti2012matter} and the presence of protons. Under the condition of charge neutrality, the resulting chemical potential was small~\cite{rafelski2023short} until the universe cooled to a temperature below $T<20\keV$ wherein the positrons vanished from the particle inventory of the universe.

We also introduce a novel spin fugacity $\xi_{s}$ and spin potential $\eta_{s}=s\eta$. While an imbalance in electrons and positrons leads to a nonzero particle chemical potential $\mu\neq0$, an imbalance in spin angular momentum within a region results in a nonzero spin potential $\eta\neq0$. As the universe appears to have zero overall angular momentum, any nonzero spin potential in the electron-positron sector would need to be compensated by either other species in the comoving volume, other sources of angular momentum, or it would indicate the presence of spin magnetized domains not unlike those found in ferromagnetic materials. We propose the spin potential follows analogous expressions as seen in \req{cpotential} obeying
\begin{align}
    \label{spotential}
    \eta\equiv\eta_{+}=-\eta_{-}\,,\qquad
    \xi\equiv\xi_{+}=\xi_{-}^{-1}\,.
\end{align}

We implement the Boltzmann approximation for the limit where $T\lesssim m_e$ which is approximately true in the temperature range of interest. The Euler-Maclaurin formula~\cite{abramowitz1988handbook} is used to convert the summation over Landau levels into an integration. The resulting partition function (after truncation of the error remainder) can then be written in terms of modified Bessel $K$ functions~\cite{abramowitz1988handbook,letessier2002hadrons} of the second kind, yielding
\begin{align}
    \label{boltzmann}
    \ln{\cal Z}_{e^{+}e^{-}}\simeq\frac{T^{3}V}{2\pi^{2}}\left[2\cosh{\frac{\mu}{T}}\right]\sum_{s}^{\pm}\xi_{s}\left(x_{s}^{2}K_{2}(x_{s})+\frac{b_{0}}{2}x_{s}K_{1}(x_{s})+\frac{b_{0}^{2}}{12}K_{0}(x_{s})\right)\,,\\
    \label{xfunc}
    2\cosh{\frac{\mu}{T}}=\lambda+\lambda^{-1}\,,\qquad
    x_{\pm}=\frac{{\tilde m}_{\pm}}{T}=\sqrt{\frac{m_{e}^{2}}{T^{2}}+b_{0}\left(1\mp\frac{g}{2}\right)}\,.
\end{align}
The latter two terms in \req{boltzmann} (proportional to $b_{0}K_{1}$ and $b_{0}^{2}K_{0}$) are the uniquely magnetic terms present (containing both paramagnetic and diamagnetic influences) in the partition function while the $K_{2}$ term is present for the relativistic free Fermi gas~\cite{greiner2012thermodynamics}. As the Bessel $K$ functions are evaluated as functions of $x_{\pm}$ in \req{xfunc}, the \lq\lq free\rq\rq\ part of the partition $K_{2}$ is still subject to spin magnetization effects.

During the $e^{+}e^{-}$ plasma epoch, the density changed dramatically over time changing the chemical potential. Therefore we can utilize the charge neutrality~\cite{rafelski2023short,letessier2002hadrons} of the universe
\begin{align}
    \label{chargeneutrality}
    n_{p}=n_{e^{-}}-n_{e^{+}}=\frac{1}{V}\lambda\frac{\partial}{\partial\lambda}\ln{\cal Z}_{e^{+}e^{-}}
\end{align}
to parameterize the chemical potential $\mu=\mu(T)$ as a function of temperature. The parameter $n_{p}$ is the number density of protons which is known in terms of the baryon-to-photon ratio~\cite{workman2022pdg}. The chemical potential is then
\begin{align}
    \label{chem}
    \sinh{\frac{\mu}{T}}=n_{p}\frac{\pi^{2}}{T^{3}}\left[\sum_{s}^{\pm}\xi_{s}\left(x_{s}^{2}K_{2}(x_{s})+\frac{b_{0}}{2}x_{s}K_{1}(x_{s})+\frac{b_{0}^{2}}{12}K_{0}(x_{s})\right)\right]^{-1}\,.
\end{align}
\req{chem} is fully determined by the right-hand-side expression if the spin fugacity is set to unity $\xi=1$ implying an equal number of polarizations both parallel and anti-parallel to the external field. In general however, an additional physical constraint is required as the chemical $\mu$ and spin $\eta$ potentials have mutual dependency. We note that such a constraint is likely related to the total angular momentum of the considered volume and does not necessarily imply that spin polarizations must be balanced within a single species when the orbital and spin momentum of all species in the plasma are taken into account.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Electron-positron magnetization}
\label{sec:magnetization}
\noindent The magnetization of the $e^{+}e^{-}$ plasma described by the partition function in \req{boltzmann} can be written as
\begin{align}
    \label{defmagetization}
    {\cal M}\equiv\frac{T}{V}\frac{\partial}{\partial{\cal B}}\ln{{\cal Z}_{e^{+}e^{-}}} = \frac{T}{V}\left(\frac{\partial b_{0}}{\partial{\cal B}}\right)\frac{\partial}{\partial b_{0}}\ln{{\cal Z}_{e^{+}e^{-}}}\,,\qquad\frac{\partial b_{0}}{\partial{\cal B}}=\frac{q}{T^{2}}\,.
\end{align}
Magnetization arising from other components in the cosmic gas (protons, neutrinos, etc...) could in principle also be included. In the context of MHD, primordial magnetogenesis from neutrino interactions in the electron-positron epoch was considered in~\cite{perrone2021neutrinoelectron}. We introduce dimensionless units for magnetization by defining the critical field
\begin{align}
    {\cal B}_{C}\equiv\frac{m_{e}^{2}}{q}\,,\qquad{\overline{\cal M}}\equiv\frac{\cal M}{{\cal B}_{C}}\,.
\end{align}

\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The scale ${\cal B}_{C}$ is where electromagnetism is expected to become subject to non-linear effects, though luckily in our regime of interest, electrodynamics should be linear. We note however that the upper bounds of IGMFs in \req{igmf} (with $b_{0}=10^{-3}$; see \req{tbscale}) brings us to within $1\%$ of that limit for the external field strength in the temperature range considered. The total magnetization ${\cal M}$ can be broken into the sum of spin parallel ${\cal M}_{+}$ and spin anti-parallel ${\cal M}_{-}$ magnetization. We note that the expression for the magnetization simplifies significantly for $g=2$ which is the \lq\lq cusp\rq\rq\ gyro-magnetic factor~\cite{rafelski2022study} for Dirac particles. For illustration, the $g=2$ magnetization from \req{defmagetization} is then
\begin{align}
    \label{g2magplus}
    {\overline{\cal M}}_{+}&=\frac{q^{2}}{\pi^{2}}\frac{T^{2}}{m_{e}^{2}}\xi\cosh{\frac{\mu}{T}}\left[\frac{1}{2}x_{+}K_{1}(x_{+})+\frac{b_{0}}{6}K_{0}(x_{+})\right]\,,\qquad x_{+}=\frac{m_{e}}{T}\,,\\
    \label{g2magminus}
    -{\overline{\cal M}}_{-}&=\frac{q^{2}}{\pi^{2}}\frac{T^{2}}{m_{e}^{2}}\xi^{-1}\cosh{\frac{\mu}{T}}\left[\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{b_{0}^{2}}{12x_{-}^{2}}\right)x_{-}K_{1}(x_{-})+\frac{b_{0}}{3}K_{0}(x_{-})\right]\,,\qquad x_{-}=\sqrt{\frac{m_{e}^{2}}{T^{2}}+2b_{0}}\,.
\end{align}
As the $g$-factor of the electron is only slightly above two at $g\simeq2.00232$~\cite{tiesinga2021codata}, the above two expressions for ${\overline{\cal M}}_{+}$ and ${\overline{\cal M}}_{-}$ are only modified by a small amount because of anomalous magnetic moment (AMM). The influence of AMM would be more relevant for the magnetization of baryon gasses since the $g$-factor for protons $(g\approx5.6)$ and neutrons $(g\approx3.8)$ are substantially different from $g=2$.

In \rf{fig:magnet}, we plot the magnetization as given by \req{g2magplus} and \req{g2magminus} with the spin potential set to unity $\xi=1$. We see that the $e^{+}e^{-}$ plasma is overall paramagnetic and yields a positive overall magnetization which is contrary to the traditional assumption that matter-antimatter plasmas lack significant magnetic responses of their own in the bulk. With that said, the magnetization never exceeds the external field under the parameters considered which shows a lack of ferromagnetic behavior. As the universe cooled, the dropping magnetization slowed at $T_{\rm split}=20.3\keV$ where positrons vanished. Thereafter the remaining electrons density $n_{e^{-}}$ only diluted with cosmic expansion.

Both figures display the constant magnetic field case (solid green) with the comoving value chosen at temperature $T_{0}~=~10\keV$.}
    \label{fig:momentperlepton}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Despite the relatively large magnetization seen in \rf{fig:magnet}, the average contribution per lepton is only a small fraction of its overall magnetic moment. Specifically, the magnetization regime we are in is described by
\begin{align}
    \label{fractionalmagnetization}
    {\cal M}V\ll\mu_{B}(N_{e^{+}}+N_{e^{-}})\,,\qquad\mu_{B}=\frac{q}{2m}\,,
\end{align}
where $\mu_{B}$ is the Bohr magneton and $N=nV$ is the total particle number in the proper volume. To better demonstrate this, we define the average magnetic moment per lepton given by along the field ($z$-direction) axis as
\begin{align}
    \label{momentperlepton}
    \langle\vec{m}\rangle_{z}\equiv\frac{{\cal M}}{n_{e^{-}}+n_{e^{+}}}\,,\qquad\langle\vec{m}\rangle_{x}=\langle\vec{m}\rangle_{y}=0\,.
\end{align}
From the spin eigen-states, we expect the transverse expectation values to be zero. The quantity given in \req{momentperlepton} gives us an insight into the microscopic response of the plasma which we will use below.

A curious feature of \rf{fig:magnet} is that the magnetization increases as a function of temperature. This is contrary to most systems which lose their magnetization at higher temperatures because of the disordering influence of thermal heat~\cite{huang1991statistical}. A standard feature of paramagnetic systems (Curie's law) is that the susceptibility of the material is suppressed as temperature increases, so it is natural ask: Why doesn't this occur for the primordial $e^{+}e^{-}$ plasma?

There are two reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[a.] As discussed in \rsec{sec:abundance}, the late $e^{+}e^{-}$ plasma saw its density decrease by a factor of $10^{9}$ as the majority of the gas annihilated leaving behind only a small residual quantity of electrons. As we travel into the distance past, the density of electrons $n_{e^{-}}$ and positrons $n_{e^{+}}$ increases by an enormous extent therefore enhancing the overall magnetization through quantity. This is shown in \rf{fig:paireffect} (left) which compares the magnetization of the gas with conserved magnetic flux $b_{0}={\rm\ const}$ and a constant field $b_{0}\propto1/T^{2}$. If the magnetic field is constant, we see the parameter responsible for magnetization at high temperatures is the pair density. In \rf{fig:paireffect} (right) we plot the chemical potential $\mu/T$ which characterizes the importance of the charged lepton asymmetry as a function of temperature. As an aside, we only plotted the $b_{0}=0$ case as the magnetic field did not visibly influence $\mu/T$ in the regime considered.
    \item[b.] The conservation of magnetic flux, as described in \req{bscale}, through comoving surfaces for the external field ensures that as we travel into the past, the magnetic field increases which enhances the overall magnetization of the gas. This phenomenon is seen in \rf{fig:paireffect} as the difference between the blue and red curves. However, a more striking visualization of this is plotted in \rf{fig:momentperlepton} where the average magnetic moment $\langle\vec{m}\rangle_{z}$ defined in \req{momentperlepton} displays how essential the external field is on the per lepton magnetization. The average magnetic moment per lepton is suppressed at higher temperatures (as expected for Curie law-like magnetization) if the field strength is held constant. A small difference is seen between the full Fermi distribution analysis and the Boltzmann approximation used in this work.

\section{Spin potential and ferromagnetism}
\label{sec:spin}
\noindent Up to this point, we have neglected the impact that a nonzero spin potential $\eta\neq0$ (and thus $\xi\neq1$) would have on the primordial $e^{+}e^{-}$ plasma. In the limit the cosmic magnetic scale (and thus external magnetic field) goes to zero, the magnetization given in \req{g2magplus} and \req{g2magminus} is entirely controlled by the spin fugacity $\xi$ asymmetry generated by the spin potential $\eta$ yielding
\begin{align}
    \lim_{b_{0}\rightarrow0}{\overline{\cal M}}=\frac{q^{2}}{\pi^{2}}\frac{T^{2}}{m_{e}^{2}}\sinh{\frac{\eta}{T}}\cosh{\frac{\mu}{T}}\left[\frac{m_{e}}{T}K_{1}\left(\frac{m_{e}}{T}\right)\right]\,,\qquad2\sinh{\frac{\eta}{T}}=\xi-\xi^{-1}\,.
\end{align}
Therefore, we can understand the spin potential as a kind of ferromagnetic influence on the primordial gas which allows for magnetization even in the absence of external magnetic fields. As $\sinh{\eta/T}$ is an odd function, the sign of $\eta$ also controls the alignment of the magnetization. In general, $\eta=\eta(\mu,T)$ is a function of the chemical potential and temperature. As discussed in \rsec{sec:fugacity}, the two potentials are mutually related likely would need be simultaneously solved. We will return to the topic of spin potential constraints under separate cover.
